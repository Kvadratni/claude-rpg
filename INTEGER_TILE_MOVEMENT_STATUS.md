# Integer Tile Movement System - Implementation Status

## âœ… **Completed Changes**

### 1. Player Class (`src/player.py`)
- **Converted to tile-based coordinates**: `tile_x`, `tile_y` instead of decimal `x`, `y`
- **Added movement animation system**: Smooth interpolation between tiles during movement
- **World coordinate properties**: `x` and `y` properties for rendering compatibility
- **Movement control**: `move_to_tile()` method for discrete tile movement
- **Save/load compatibility**: Handles both old and new save formats

### 2. Movement System (`src/systems/movement.py`)
- **Simplified tile-based movement**: No more complex sub-tile pathfinding
- **WASD movement**: Direct tile-to-tile movement with walkability checking
- **Mouse movement**: Uses tile-based pathfinding with discrete steps
- **Entity interaction**: Tile-based entity detection and interaction
- **Path visualization**: Shows tile-based movement paths

## ðŸ”„ **Still Needed**

### 3. Level System Updates
Need to add these methods to level classes:

```python
def is_tile_walkable(self, tile_x, tile_y):
    """Check if a tile is walkable (simple boolean check)"""
    
def find_tile_path(self, start_tile_x, start_tile_y, end_tile_x, end_tile_y):
    """Simple A* pathfinding between tiles (returns list of tile coordinates)"""
```

### 4. Entity Position Updates
All entities (NPCs, enemies, items, chests) should use integer tile positions:
- Convert entity coordinates to tile-based
- Update entity spawning to use tile coordinates
- Update collision detection to tile-based

### 5. Chunk System Integration
Ensure chunk-based worlds work with tile coordinates:
- Update chunk coordinate calculations
- Ensure settlement spawning uses tile coordinates

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Simplified Logic**: No more complex floating-point calculations
2. **Predictable Movement**: Always know exactly which tile entities occupy
3. **Better Performance**: Integer operations are faster than floating-point
4. **Easier Debugging**: Clear integer positions instead of decimal approximations
5. **Chunk Compatibility**: Perfect alignment with integer-based chunk systems
6. **Smooth Animation**: Visual movement is still smooth via interpolation

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. Add `is_tile_walkable()` and `find_tile_path()` methods to level classes
2. Update all entities to use tile-based positioning
3. Test the system with both template levels and procedural chunk-based worlds
4. Ensure settlement system works with tile coordinates

The core player movement system is now tile-based and ready for testing!
