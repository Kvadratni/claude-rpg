# 🔧 **Fixed: Wrong Directory Issue**

## ✅ **Problem Identified**

You were absolutely right! I was working in the wrong directory and branch. There are **two separate projects**:

1. **`/Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg`** - Main game (where I mistakenly added HTTP MCP)
2. **`/Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg-goose-npcs`** - NPCs project (where the recipes are)

## 🎯 **Correct Setup**

The recipes should connect to the **NPCs project**, not the main game. I've now:

1. ✅ **Copied HTTP MCP server** to `/Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg-goose-npcs/src/mcp_server.py`
2. ✅ **Integrated it into NPCs game.py** with proper imports and initialization
3. ✅ **Added FastAPI dependencies** to NPCs project's `pyproject.toml`

## 🚀 **Correct Usage**

### **Start the NPCs Game (with HTTP MCP Server)**
```bash
cd /Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg-goose-npcs
./launch_game.sh
```

### **Test Recipe Connection**
```bash
cd /Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg-goose-npcs
goose run --recipe recipes/innkeeper.yaml \
  --params context="You are in a fantasy RPG village" \
  --interactive \
  --name npc_innkeeper
```

## 📋 **What Changed**

### **NPCs Project Now Has:**
- ✅ HTTP MCP server (`src/mcp_server.py`)
- ✅ Game integration with MCP startup/shutdown
- ✅ FastAPI dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Proper launch script that starts everything

### **Recipe Configuration (Correct):**
```yaml
extensions:
- type: sse
  name: rpg-game-server
  display_name: RPG Game Actions
  timeout: 30
  uri: http://localhost:39301/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse
```

## 🎮 **Test Steps**

1. **Start the NPCs game**: `cd /Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg-goose-npcs && ./launch_game.sh`
2. **Wait for**: "🌐 MCP Server started for AI NPCs" message
3. **Run recipe**: Use the correct command with quotes (not backticks)
4. **Verify**: Should connect without "Transport was not connected" error

The HTTP MCP server should now be running in the correct project! 🎯
