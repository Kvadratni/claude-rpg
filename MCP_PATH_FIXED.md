# 🔧 **MCP PATH ISSUE FIXED!**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified & Resolved**

The issue was that Goose couldn't find the `rpg-mcp` command because it wasn't in Goose's PATH when running recipes.

### ❌ **What Was Happening**
```
🔧 [BaseAINPC] AI response for Innkeeper: 'Execution failed: Extension 'rpg-game-server' not found. Please check the extension name and try again.'
```

**Root Cause**: Recipe used `cmd: rpg-mcp` but Goose couldn't find the command in its PATH.

### ✅ **Solution Applied**

Updated all 11 recipe files to use the **full path** to the MCP server:

**Before**:
```yaml
cmd: rpg-mcp
args: []
```

**After**:
```yaml
cmd: /Users/mnovich/.local/bin/rpg-mcp
args: []
```

### 🛠️ **Files Updated**

All 11 recipe files now use the full path:
- ✅ `blacksmith.yaml`
- ✅ `caravan_master.yaml`
- ✅ `forest_ranger.yaml`
- ✅ `guard_captain.yaml`
- ✅ `healer.yaml`
- ✅ `innkeeper.yaml`
- ✅ `master_herbalist.yaml`
- ✅ `master_merchant.yaml`
- ✅ `master_smith.yaml`
- ✅ `tavern_keeper.yaml`
- ✅ `village_elder.yaml`

### 🎮 **Expected Behavior Now**

When you interact with NPCs:

1. ✅ **AI Chat Works**: NPCs respond in character
2. ✅ **MCP Extension Found**: Goose can locate `/Users/mnovich/.local/bin/rpg-mcp`
3. ✅ **MCP Tools Available**: `open_shop`, `create_quest`, `get_player_info`, etc.
4. ✅ **Shop Integration**: NPCs will use `open_shop` tool instead of automatic opening

### 🚀 **Ready to Test Again!**

The MCP integration should now work properly. When you talk to the Innkeeper and ask to trade, you should see:

1. ✅ **AI Response**: Innkeeper responds in character
2. ✅ **MCP Extension Loads**: `rpg-game-server` extension found and enabled
3. ✅ **Tools Execute**: `open_shop` tool called successfully
4. ✅ **Game Integration**: Shop interface opens via MCP action queue

### 🔍 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the game again**: Try talking to the Innkeeper about trading
2. **Look for success logs**: Should see MCP tools being called
3. **Check action queue**: Look for `mcp_actions_queue.json` file with shop actions

The PATH issue is now resolved! 🎉
