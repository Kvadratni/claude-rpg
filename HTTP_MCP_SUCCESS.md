# 🎉 **HTTP-Based MCP Server - SUCCESS!**

## ✅ **Working Implementation**

The HTTP-based MCP server is now fully functional and eliminates all the complexity we had with stdio-based approaches.

### **Server Status**
- **✅ HTTP Server**: Running on `http://localhost:39301`
- **✅ MCP Protocol**: Implements MCP 2024-11-05 specification
- **✅ SSE Endpoint**: `http://localhost:39301/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse`
- **✅ Tools Available**: 6 game interaction tools
- **✅ Real-time Communication**: Server-Sent Events for live updates

### **Available Tools**
1. **`get_player_info`** - Get current player stats, inventory, and status
2. **`open_shop`** - Open the shop interface for trading items
3. **`give_item`** - Give an item to the player
4. **`create_quest`** - Create a new quest for the player
5. **`get_world_info`** - Get information about the current game world and location
6. **`send_message`** - Send a message to the game log

### **Test Results**
```json
{
    "name": "RPG Game MCP Server",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "protocol": "mcp/2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
        "tools": true,

}
```

## 🚀 **How to Use with Goose**

### **1. Start the Game**
```bash
cd /Users/mnovich/Development/claude-rpg
uv run goose-rpg
```
The MCP server automatically starts when the game launches.

### **2. Configure Goose Extension**
Add this remote extension to your Goose configuration:

**Extension Details:**
- **Name**: RPG Game
- **Type**: Remote Extension
- **SSE Endpoint**: `http://localhost:39301/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse`
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds

### **3. Use with AI NPCs**
The AI can now directly interact with your game using the available tools!

## 🎮 **Example AI Interactions**

### **Merchant NPC**
```
AI: "Welcome to my shop! Let me open it for you."
→ Calls: open_shop(shop_type="general")
→ Game: Opens shop interface

AI: "Here's a health potion for your journey!"
→ Calls: give_item(item_name="health_potion", quantity=1)
→ Game: Adds item to player inventory
```

### **Quest Giver NPC**
```
AI: "I have a task for you, brave adventurer!"
→ Calls: create_quest(
    title="Goblin Trouble",
    description="Clear the goblins from the nearby cave",
    reward="50 gold and a magic sword"
  )
→ Game: Creates new quest for player
```

### **Information NPC**
```
AI: "Let me check your current status..."
→ Calls: get_player_info()
→ Game: Returns player stats, health, inventory, etc.

AI: "This area is known for its dangerous creatures..."
→ Calls: get_world_info()
→ Game: Returns current location, weather, nearby entities
```
