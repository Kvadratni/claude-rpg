# 🎨 NPC Sprite Generation - Mission Complete!

## ✅ Problem Solved
You identified that several new NPCs were sharing sprites inappropriately, which would make them visually indistinguishable in the game. This has been completely resolved!

## 🖼️ Generated Sprites

Using the AI image generator, I created **7 dedicated NPC sprites**:

### New Unique Sprites Created:
1. **`desert_guide.png`** - Desert guide with traditional robes and turban
2. **`head_miner.png`** - Mining leader with helmet and professional mining gear  
3. **`master_fisher.png`** - Experienced fisherman with hat and fishing equipment
4. **`trade_master.png`** - Wealthy merchant in fine clothes with trading tools
5. **`stable_master.png`** - Horse caretaker in practical work attire
6. **`water_keeper.png`** - Desert water guardian in blue protective robes
7. **`lodge_keeper.png`** - Mountain lodge host in warm, welcoming attire
