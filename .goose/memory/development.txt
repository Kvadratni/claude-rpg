# rpg isometric features
Claude RPG needs to be redesigned as a proper isometric RPG with:
1. True isometric rendering (diamond-shaped tiles)
2. Proper sprite depth sorting
3. More RPG features (inventory, equipment, NPCs, quests)
4. Better graphics and animations
5. Multiple levels/areas
6. More complex combat system
