## üéØ **FINAL STATUS: SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION**

All critical issues have been resolved and the AI NPC system has been successfully refactored to use interactive conversation recipes instead of templated messages.

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED TASKS**

### 1. **Recipe System Overhaul**
- ‚úÖ **Updated all 11 recipe files** to interactive conversation format
- ‚úÖ **Removed `message` parameter** from all recipes 
- ‚úÖ **Replaced templated format** with direct conversation instructions
- ‚úÖ **All recipes validate successfully** with Goose CLI

### 2. **Fixed Critical CLI Issues**
- ‚úÖ **Removed problematic `--name` flag** that was causing Goose CLI errors
- ‚úÖ **Updated session initialization** to use current Goose CLI syntax
- ‚úÖ **Verified deeplink generation** works for all NPCs

### 3. **Enhanced System Architecture**
- ‚úÖ **Persistent session management** - Each NPC maintains its own Goose session
- ‚úÖ **Session state tracking** - Proper initialization and cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive debug logging** - Full visibility into AI execution flow
- ‚úÖ **Resource management** - Prevents process leaks and memory issues

### 4. **Updated Recipe Files**
**Before (Templated):**
```yaml
PLAYER SAYS: "{{ message }}"
Respond as the Village Elder to the player's message...

parameters:
  - key: message
    requirement: user_prompt
```

**After (Interactive):**
```yaml
You are now ready to have a conversation with the player. 
Respond to their messages as the Village Elder.

parameters:
  - key: context
    requirement: optional
```
