# Goose RPG
## ü§ñ **100% AI-Developed Game**

This complete isometric RPG was **entirely created by artificial intelligence** with zero human programming. Every line of code, every game system, and every feature was designed and implemented by AI.

### AI Development Team
- **Programming**: Goose AI agent using Claude 4 Sonnet

- **Music**: Composed by Udio AI
- **Sound Effects**: Sourced as freeware by Claude
- **Human Role**: Creative prompting and direction only

**This demonstrates what AI can accomplish in game development when given creative freedom.**
