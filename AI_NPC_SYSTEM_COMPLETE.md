```
Player: "I need some equipment"
Master Merchant: *checks player gold with get_player_info*
Master Merchant: "Ah, I see you have 150 gold. Let me show you some fine weapons!"
Master Merchant: *uses open_shop to start trading interface*
```

#### **Dynamic Quest Creation:**
```
Player: "Do you have any work for me?"
Village Elder: *checks player level with get_player_info*
Village Elder: *uses create_quest to generate appropriate challenge*
Village Elder: "The forest bandits threaten our trade routes. Clear them out for 200 gold!"
```

#### **Contextual Item Giving:**
```
Player: "I'm hurt and need healing"
Healer: *checks player HP with get_player_info*
Healer: *uses give_item to provide health potions*
