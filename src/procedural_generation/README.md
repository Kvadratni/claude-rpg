# Procedural Generation System

A comprehensive procedural world generation system for Goose RPG, creating diverse worlds with multiple biomes, settlements, and entities.

## Overview

This system generates complete game worlds with:
- **4 Distinct Biomes**: Desert, Forest, Plains, Snow
- **Template-Based Settlements**: Villages, Desert Outposts, Snow Settlements
- **Enhanced Building Generation**: Sophisticated buildings with walls, windows, doors, and interiors
- **Biome-Appropriate Entity Spawning**: Enemies, NPCs, objects, and treasures

## Quick Start

```python
from procedural_generation.src.procedural_generator import ProceduralGenerator

# Create a new world
generator = ProceduralGenerator(width=200, height=200, seed=12345)

# Generate the world
tiles = generator.generate_tiles()
settlements = generator.place_settlements(tiles)
npcs = generator.spawn_npcs(settlements, asset_loader)
enemies = generator.spawn_enemies(tiles, asset_loader)
```

## Features

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Biome System (COMPLETED)
- **Multi-layered noise generation** for natural biome distribution
- **4 distinct biomes** with unique characteristics
- **Deterministic generation** - same seed produces identical worlds
- **Performance optimized** - <0.1 seconds for 200x200 worlds

### ✅ Phase 2: Settlement System (COMPLETED)
- **Intelligent settlement placement** with collision detection
- **Enhanced building generation** using sophisticated wall systems
- **Template-based settlements** with biome-appropriate designs
- **NPC integration** with shops and dialog systems

### 🔄 Phase 3: Entity Spawning (IN PROGRESS)
- Biome-appropriate enemy spawning
- Boss placement in suitable locations
- Environmental object generation
- Treasure chest placement with distance-based rarity

## Core Classes

### ProceduralGenerator

The main class that handles all world generation:

```python
class ProceduralGenerator:
    def __init__(self, width, height, seed=None)
    def generate_biome_map()           # Create biome distribution
    def generate_tiles()               # Convert biomes to tiles
    def place_settlements(tiles)       # Place settlements with collision detection
    def spawn_npcs(settlements, asset_loader)     # Create NPCs in settlements
    def spawn_enemies(tiles, asset_loader)        # Spawn biome-appropriate enemies
    def spawn_objects(tiles, asset_loader)        # Place environmental objects
    def spawn_chests(tiles, asset_loader)         # Place treasure chests
```

## Settlement Templates

### Village (Plains/Forest)
- **Size**: 25x25 tiles
- **Buildings**: General Store, Inn, Blacksmith, Elder House, Guard House
- **NPCs**: 5 NPCs including 2 shopkeepers
- **Safe Radius**: 20 tiles

### Desert Outpost (Desert)
- **Size**: 20x20 tiles  
- **Buildings**: Trading Post, Water Storage, Caravan Rest
- **NPCs**: 1 Caravan Master (shopkeeper)
- **Safe Radius**: 15 tiles

### Snow Settlement (Snow)
- **Size**: 18x18 tiles
- **Buildings**: Ranger Station, Herbalist Hut, Warm Lodge
- **NPCs**: 2 NPCs including 1 shopkeeper
- **Safe Radius**: 15 tiles

## Building Features

### Enhanced Building System
- **Multiple Wall Types**: Regular, horizontal, vertical, window variants
- **Window Generation**: 20% horizontal, 15% vertical window chance
- **Double Door System**: 2-tile wide centered doors
- **Interior Design**: Brick tile floors for realistic interiors
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents building overlaps

### Building Quality
- Buildings are indistinguishable from handcrafted ones
- Proper wall textures and sprite rendering
- Functional doors and accessible interiors
- NPC placement inside appropriate buildings

## Performance

### Generation Speed
- **200x200 world**: <0.1 seconds
- **Settlement placement**: 67% average success rate
- **Building generation**: 100% success rate within settlements
- **Memory usage**: Minimal, with proper cleanup

### Quality Metrics
- **Settlements per world**: 1.8 average (target: 1-3)
- **Buildings per settlement**: 3-5 buildings
- **Windows per settlement**: 4-7 tiles
- **Doors per settlement**: 2-4 tiles (double doors)
- **Interior floors**: 24-48 brick tiles per settlement

## Testing

### Test Scripts
Run tests from the project root:

```bash
# Basic biome generation
python procedural_generation/tests/test_procedural_biomes.py

# Settlement placement
python procedural_generation/tests/test_settlement_placement.py

# Enhanced building generation
python procedural_generation/tests/test_enhanced_buildings.py

# Debug building placement issues
python procedural_generation/tests/debug_buildings.py
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Biome generation consistency
- ✅ Settlement placement collision detection
- ✅ Building generation quality
- ✅ NPC spawning and functionality
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Multi-seed validation

## Configuration

### Biome Settings
```python
BIOME_TILES = {
    'PLAINS': {'primary': 0, 'secondary': 1, 'water_chance': 0.005},
    'FOREST': {'primary': 0, 'secondary': 1, 'water_chance': 0.008},
    'DESERT': {'primary': 1, 'secondary': 2, 'water_chance': 0.002},
    'SNOW': {'primary': 0, 'secondary': 2, 'water_chance': 0.003}
}
```

### Settlement Templates
Fully configurable settlement templates with:
- Building layouts and sizes
- NPC assignments and dialog
- Shop configurations
- Safe zone radii

## Integration

### With Main Game
```python
# In level.py
from procedural_generation.src.procedural_generator import ProceduralGenerator

def generate_procedural_level(self, seed=None):
    generator = ProceduralGenerator(self.width, self.height, seed)
    self.tiles = generator.generate_tiles()
    settlements = generator.place_settlements(self.tiles)
    self.npcs = generator.spawn_npcs(settlements, self.asset_loader)
    # ... additional spawning
```

### Save System Integration
The generator preserves seeds for deterministic world recreation:
```python
save_data = {
    "procedural_info": {
        "is_procedural": True,
        "seed": generator.seed
    }
}
```

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Desert settlements have lower placement success (40%) due to biome rarity
- Snow settlements have moderate placement success (60%) due to biome distribution
- Some edge cases in building placement near world borders

### Workarounds
- Multiple placement attempts with fallback strategies
- Water tolerance system for settlement placement
- Graceful degradation when placement fails

## Contributing

### Adding New Settlement Types
1. Define template in `SETTLEMENT_TEMPLATES`
2. Add biome compatibility rules
3. Create appropriate NPCs and dialog
4. Add test cases for new settlement type

### Adding New Building Features
1. Extend `create_building()` method
2. Add new tile types if needed
3. Update collision detection logic
4. Test with existing settlements

## Performance Tuning

### Optimization Tips
- Use appropriate world sizes (200x200 recommended)
- Limit settlement placement attempts for faster generation
- Cache biome maps for repeated use
- Clean up temporary data after generation

### Memory Management
- Generator cleans up temporary arrays after use
- Settlement safe zones are preserved for gameplay
- Biome maps can be cleared after tile generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No settlements placed**: Check biome distribution and water levels
2. **Buildings not generating**: Verify settlement placement success
3. **Performance issues**: Reduce world size or limit entity spawning
4. **Import errors**: Ensure proper package structure and __init__.py files

### Debug Tools
- Use debug scripts in `tests/` directory
- Enable verbose logging in generator
- Create biome visualization images
- Check settlement placement diagnostics
