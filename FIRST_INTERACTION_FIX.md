# AI NPC System - First Interaction Fix

## Issue Fixed
The AI NPC system was immediately falling back to non-AI responses when the first interaction returned an empty response from the Goose session initialization. This is normal behavior during session startup, but the system was treating it as a failure.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added First Interaction Tracking**
- Added `first_interaction: bool = True` flag to `BaseAINPC.__init__()`
- Tracks whether this is the NPC's first interaction with any player

### 2. **Modified Response Handling Logic**
Updated `send_ai_message()` method to handle first interactions gracefully:

**Before:**
```python
if response and len(response.strip()) > 10:
    # Accept response
else:
    # Immediately switch to fallback
    self.use_fallback = True
    return self._fallback_response(message)
```

**After:**
```python
if self.first_interaction:
    self.first_interaction = False
    if not response or len(response.strip()) <= 10:
        # Return a "looks at you" message for first interaction
        return f"*{self.name} looks at you thoughtfully*"
    else:
        # We got a good response on first try
        return response

# For subsequent interactions, require proper response
if response and len(response.strip()) > 10:
    return response
else:
    # Only switch to fallback after first interaction
    self.use_fallback = True
    return self._fallback_response(message)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- First interaction errors return contextual "looks at you" messages
- Only subsequent failures trigger permanent fallback mode
- Preserves AI functionality for future interactions

### 4. **Updated Save/Load System**
- Added `first_interaction` to save data
- Ensures proper state restoration across game sessions

## Expected Behavior

### **First Interaction:**
- If AI session returns empty/short response: `"*Village Elder looks at you thoughtfully*"`
- If AI session returns good response: Use the AI response
- Never switches to permanent fallback on first interaction

### **Subsequent Interactions:**
- Require proper AI responses (>10 characters)
- Switch to fallback only if AI consistently fails
- Maintain conversation history and context

## Benefits

1. **Graceful Session Initialization** - No immediate fallback during startup
2. **Better User Experience** - Players see contextual "NPC notices you" messages
3. **Preserved AI Functionality** - System doesn't give up after first empty response
4. **Natural Interaction Flow** - NPCs appear to be considering their response initially

## Files Modified
- `src/entities/ai_npc_base.py` - Core logic changes
  - Added `first_interaction` tracking
  - Modified `send_ai_message()` method
  - Updated save/load methods

This fix ensures that the AI NPC system handles the normal session initialization gracefully while maintaining robust error handling for genuine AI failures.
